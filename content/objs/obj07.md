By the end of this week, students should be able to

* Enumerate and describe graphical perception, and put the theory into practice for producing effective data plots.
* Enumerate and describe colour theory, and select the appropriate colour palette depending on data types.
* Modify plots by controlling how data is mapped to perceptual properties via scales.
* Annotate plots by adding informative titles and labels for better communication.
