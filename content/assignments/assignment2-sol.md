title: Assignment 2 Solution
---

This assignment is **due 23:59 Friday 30 April (NZST)**.

-   You should submit an R file (i.e.Â file extension `.R`) containing R
    code that assigns **the appropriate values** to **the appropriate
    symbols**.
-   Your R file will be executed in order and checked against the values
    that have been assigned to the relevant symbols using an
    **automatic** grading system. Marks will be fully deducted for
    **non-identical** results.
-   Intermediate steps to achieve the final results will NOT be checked.
-   Each question is worth 1 point.
-   You should submit your R file on Canvas.
-   Late assignments are NOT accepted unless prior arrangement for
    medical/compassionate reasons.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

In this assignment, you will continue working with 2018 Citi Bike trip
data in New York City (`2018-citibike-tripdata.csv`). The data includes:

-   Trip Duration (seconds)
-   Start Time and Date
-   Stop Time and Date
-   Start Station Name
-   End Station Name
-   Station ID
-   Station Lat/Long
-   Bike ID
-   User Type (Customer = 24-hour pass or 3-day pass user; Subscriber =
    Annual Member)
-   Gender (0=unknown; 1=male; 2=female)
-   Year of Birth

You shall use the following code snippet (and **include them upfront in
your R file**) to start with this assignment:

``` r
library(lubridate)
library(tidyverse)
nycbikes18 <- read_csv("data/2018-citibike-tripdata.csv",
  locale = locale(tz = "America/New_York"))
nycbikes18
```

    #> #   end_station_latitude <dbl>, end_station_longitude <dbl>,
    #> #   bikeid <dbl>, usertype <chr>, birth_year <dbl>, gender <dbl>

Suppose that you have created an `Rproj` for this course. You need to
download `2018-citibike-tripdata.csv`
[here](https://github.com/STATS-UOA/stats220/releases/download/v1.0/2018-citibike-tripdata.csv)
to `data/` under your `Rproj` folder.

-   Youâ€™re required to use **relative file paths
    `data/2018-citibike-tripdata.csv`** to import the data. **NO marks
    will be given for using URL links or different file paths for this
    assignment.**
-   NO marks given to the question, in which you apply `theme()` and
    aesthetics other than what I instruct to the plot.

### Question 1

Letâ€™s take a second look ðŸ˜‰ at where Citi bike stations are located.
Visualise the following layered bubble charts:

1.  points of all start stations. Sizes vary with the total number of
    pickups.
2.  points of all end stations. Sizes vary with the total number of
    returns.

You should end up with a **ggplot** object named `p1`, with
`alpha = 0.5` to both layers.

1.  Check out the
    [{ggplot2}](https://ggplot2.tidyverse.org/reference/index.html#section-layers)
    reference page for a handy `geom_*()` to quickly get this done.

</details>

<br>

``` r
p1 <- nycbikes18 %>%
  ggplot() +
  geom_count(aes(start_station_longitude, start_station_latitude),
    alpha = 0.5) +
  geom_count(aes(end_station_longitude, end_station_latitude),
    alpha = 0.5)
p1
```

### Question 2

Find **the most frequently used bike**â€™s data records.

You should end up with a **tibble** called `top_bike_trips`.

``` r
most_used_bike <- nycbikes18 %>% 
  count(bikeid, sort = TRUE) %>% 
  pull(bikeid) %>% 
  first()
top_bike_trips <- nycbikes18 %>% 
  filter(bikeid == most_used_bike)
top_bike_trips
```

    #> # A tibble: 825 x 15
    #>    tripduration starttime           stoptime           
    #>           <dbl> <dttm>              <dttm>

    #> # â€¦ with 815 more rows, and 12 more variables:
    #> #   start_station_id <dbl>, start_station_name <chr>,
    #> #   start_station_latitude <dbl>, start_station_longitude <dbl>,
    #> #   end_station_id <dbl>, end_station_name <chr>,
    #> #   end_station_latitude <dbl>, end_station_longitude <dbl>,
    #> #   bikeid <dbl>, usertype <chr>, birth_year <dbl>, gender <dbl>

### Question 3

Plot all journeys that the most frequently used bike has travelled on.

You should end up with a **ggplot** called `p2`, with `alpha = 0.5`.

``` r
p2 <- top_bike_trips %>% 
  ggplot(aes(start_station_longitude, start_station_latitude)) +
  geom_segment(
    aes(xend = end_station_longitude, yend = end_station_latitude),
    alpha = 0.5)
p2
```

### Question 4

In order to study different riding behaviours by age groups, youâ€™ll
transform `nycbikes18` to a **tibble** called `nycbikes18_age`:

1.  modify `tripduration` to be converted in minutes.
2.  when `birth_year` is less than 1900, replace values with `NA_real_`.
3.  add a new column `age` derived from userâ€™s birth year based on 2018.
4.  add a new column `age_group` that bins `age` into groups: 0-14,
    15-24, 25-44, 45-64, 65+.

``` r
age_brk <- c(0, 14, 24, 44, 64, Inf)
nycbikes18_age <- nycbikes18 %>% 
  mutate(
    tripduration = tripduration / 60,
    birth_year = case_when(birth_year < 1900 ~ NA_real_, TRUE ~ birth_year),
    age = 2018 - birth_year,
    age_group = cut(age, age_brk, include.lowest = TRUE),
    age_group = fct_recode(age_group, "65+" = "(64,Inf]")
  )
glimpse(nycbikes18_age)
```

    #> Rows: 333,687
    #> Columns: 17

``` r
sum(is.na(nycbikes18_age$birth_year))
```

    #> [1] 126

``` r
mean(nycbikes18_age$age, na.rm = TRUE)
```

    #> [1] 37.63694

``` r
levels(nycbikes18_age$age_group)
```

    #> [1] "[0,14]"  "(14,24]" "(24,44]" "(44,64]" "65+"

### Question 5

Generate a side-by-side boxplot to demonstrate the differences of trip
durations across age groups coloured by user types. (**NOTE:** you need
to modify labels of this plot.)

You should end up with a **ggplot** called `p3`, with

-   labeling `"Age Group"` to x axis
-   labeling `"Trip in minutes (on log10)"` to y axis

``` r
p3 <- nycbikes18_age %>% 
  ggplot(aes(age_group, tripduration)) +
  geom_boxplot(aes(colour = usertype)) +
  scale_y_log10() +
  labs(x = "Age Group", y = "Trip in minutes (on log10)")
p3
```

<img src="/figures/a2-q5-1.png" width="840" />

### Question 6

Plot a grouped bar chart that sums up the number of trips by months of
`startime` and gender.

You should end up with a **ggplot** called `p4`.

<details>
<summary>
HINTS
</summary>

Key steps:

1.  extract months of `starttime`.
2.  modify `gender`.

</details>

<br>

``` r
p4 <- nycbikes18 %>% 
  group_by(month = month(starttime, label = TRUE), gender) %>% 
  summarise(ntrips = n()) %>% 
  ungroup() %>% 
  mutate(gender = fct_recode(fct_reorder(as_factor(gender), ntrips),
    "unknown" = "0", "male" = "1", "female" = "2")) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(gender, ntrips)) +
  geom_col(aes(fill = month), position = "dodge")
p4
```

<img src="/figures/a2-q6-1.png" width="840" />

### Question 7

Produce a line graph depicting **the 3rd quantile of trip durations** by
months of `starttime` and age groups. (**NOTE:** check out the legend
order that matches to the last value of each line.)

You should end up with a **ggplot** called `p5`.

<details>
<summary>
HINTS
</summary>

1.  Check out the
    [{forcats}](https://forcats.tidyverse.org/reference/index.html#section-change-order-of-levels)
    reference page for a function that you can reorder the levels of
    `age_group` as required.
2.  You need to use `aes(group = <GROUP>)` to show lines.

</details>

<br>

``` r
p5 <- nycbikes18_age %>% 
  group_by(month = month(starttime, label = TRUE), age_group) %>% 
  summarise(qtl_tripd = quantile(tripduration, 0.75)) %>% 
  mutate(age_group = fct_reorder2(age_group, month, qtl_tripd)) %>% 
  ungroup() %>% 
  ggplot(aes(month, qtl_tripd, group = age_group)) +
  geom_line(aes(colour = age_group))
p5
```

<img src="/figures/a2-q7-1.png" width="840" />

### Question 8

Present the following pivot table that counts the number of trips by
upper-tail userâ€™s types and age groups. **Upper-tail users are defined
as the ones who ride for longer periods than 90% of users of the same
age group.** (**NOTE:** the column headers of `user_behaviours`)

You should end up with a **tibble** called `user_behaviours`.

<details>
<summary>
HINTS
</summary>

Key steps:

1.  subset.
2.  summarise.
3.  pivot.

</details>

<br>

``` r
user_behaviours <- nycbikes18_age %>% 
  group_by(age_group) %>% 
  filter(tripduration > quantile(tripduration, 0.9)) %>% 
  group_by(usertype, age_group) %>% 
  summarise(ntrips = n()) %>% 
  rename(`Age Group` = age_group) %>% 
  pivot_wider(names_from = usertype, values_from = ntrips)
user_behaviours
```

    #> # A tibble: 5 x 3
    #>   `Age Group` Customer Subscriber
    #>   <fct>          <int>      <int>
    #> 1 (14,24]          641        706
    #> 2 (24,44]         3749      19864
    #> 3 (44,64]         4760       3275
    #> 4 65+               25        289
    #> 5 <NA>              NA         13

### Question 9

Youâ€™re going to get `nycbikes18` prepared in a form for the final
question:

1.  modify `starttime` down to the nearest hour.
2.  aggregate to hourly number of trips (denoted as `ntrips`) by user
    types.
3.  add new columns `startdate`, `starthour`, and `startwday` that
    contain dates, hours of the day, and weekdays respectively extracted
    from `starttime`.

You should end up with a **tibble** called `hourly_ntrips`.

``` r
hourly_ntrips <- nycbikes18 %>% 
  mutate(starttime = floor_date(starttime, "1 hour")) %>% 
  group_by(starttime, usertype) %>% 
  summarise(ntrips = n()) %>% 
  ungroup() %>% 
  mutate(
    startdate = as_date(starttime),
    starthour = hour(starttime),
    startwday = wday(starttime, label = TRUE, week_start = 1)
  )
hourly_ntrips
```

    #> # A tibble: 11,739 x 6
    #>    starttime           usertype  ntrips startdate  starthour startwday

    #> # â€¦ with 11,729 more rows

``` r
mean(hourly_ntrips$starttime)
```

    #> [1] "2018-06-29 14:11:53 EDT"

``` r
mean(hourly_ntrips$ntrips)
```

    #> [1] 28.4255

``` r
levels(hourly_ntrips$startwday)
```

    #> [1] "Mon" "Tue" "Wed" "Thu" "Fri" "Sat" "Sun"

### Question 10

Letâ€™s look at user behaviours between Subscriber and Customer in
temporal context. Visualise the following layered graphics, faceted by
weekdays and user types:

1.  grey lines indicating the hourly number of trips against time of the
    day from `hourly_ntrips`, with `colour = "#bdbdbd"` and
    `alpha = 0.5`.
2.  superimposed lines indicating the average number of trips by hours
    of the day, weekdays, and user types, with `size = 1`.

You should end up with a **ggplot** object named `p6` with a
black-and-white theme.

### Question4fun (NO marks)

Create an interactive map that marks all bike stations in clusters. By
zooming in and out, you can see how clusters change. By hovering
individual markers, you should be able to query the station name.

``` r
library(leaflet)
start_station <- nycbikes18 %>% 
  distinct(start_station_longitude, start_station_latitude, 
    start_station_name) %>% 
  rename_with(~ c("station", "lat", "long"))
end_station <- nycbikes18 %>% 
  distinct(end_station_longitude, end_station_latitude,
    end_station_name) %>% 
  rename_with(~ c("station", "lat", "long"))
stations <- bind_rows(start_station, end_station) %>% 
  distinct(lat, long, station)
stations %>% 
  leaflet() %>% 
  addTiles() %>% 
  addMarkers(label = ~ station, clusterOptions = markerClusterOptions()) %>% 
  addProviderTiles(providers$CartoDB.Positron)
```
